Difficulty Level: 3
------------
Goals:
------------
In this excercise we'll learn to write our own package,
the difference between package and a module, and how python
detects packages it imports

------------
Material:
------------
1:
Definitive guide for python import statements:

2:
KUDOS KeyNote #2

---------------
Preperations:
---------------
Create a directory inside your "HOME" directory, 
call this folder "python_import"

BASH:
-------
cd ~
mkdir python_import
-------

In the tutorial folder you'll find a file called "my_first_import.py"
Copy thie file to the "python_import" folder

------------
Excercise:
------------

1. Create new python file in your editor, make sure that 
your new python file isn't found inside the "python_import" folder 
we've just created

Note:
Class recommendation is solving entire excercises inside a folder called
"python_excercises" inside your HOME directory
See "How to solve Kudos Excercises?" page provided in the first
class lecture

2. Try to import "my_first_python" file,
by adding the line "import my_first_python" line to your python module
Run your python file, what happened?

Questions:
#1 Why the python import failed?
#2 Any idea how to solve the importing issue?

3. At this stage we'll add "python_import" folder into
python import search location

Hint #1: Python having several hints for searching imports,
at this excercise try to add the path into "sys.path" folder

4. Try to import "my_first_python" again
If the import failed again, please go again to subject 3 
(or look at the solution...)
Afterwards please use the "imported_function" found 
inside the the "python_import" file

Questions:
#1 - What happened while you've imported the package?
Can you explain why it happened?

5. Please import "sys" package, and print "sys.path"
Note: At this stage you should've import at least
once the sys package and use sys path

Questions:
#1 What is "path"? Think in python terminiology, which
python structure is it?
#2 What are the importance of paths find inside "sys.path"?
#3 What will happen if we'll remove entire sys path? How can we do that?
