Excercise:
------------
In this excercise we'll import functions from the "random" package in varius ways, 
and ask ourselves what's the benefit importing in each situation

1:
Import the "random" package, in your python file
Now, call "randint" function without any other import

Question;
What's the benefit importing entire pakage instead of specific function from the package?

2:
Import "randint" specifically from the random package and call the function

Question;
What's the benefit importing specific function instead of the entire package?

3:
Import entire function from "random" package,
afterwards call the "randint" package

Ask yourself, what's the disatvange of using this 

*4*:
Import "randint" specifically from the random package and call the function (same as in subject 2)
After the line of the import, declare a variable called "randint" and assign variable 3 to it (randint = 3)
Try to call randint function, can you do it?
Ask yourself, what happened here?
