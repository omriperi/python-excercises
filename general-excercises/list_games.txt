- Using several attributes of a list

1. Filtering duplicates
Please create a list with 20 random integers, from the range 1 to 10
After creating this list, please remove any duplicate integers from it
For example, if at start you've created a list that looks like:
[1, 10, 9, 4, 4, 1, 5, 4, 8, 6, 10, 7, 3, 2, 5, 10, 10, 10, 6, 1]
After you'll clean the duplications it should look like:
[1, 10, 9, 4, 5, 8, 6, 7, 3, 2]

2. Concatinating lists
Please create two lists, one with 10 random integers from the number 1-10
and the second with 5 random integer from the number 1-5
Prepare a third list containing the values from both the lists

Question #1:
There are multiple ways concatinating a list (connecting two lists together)
which method you choose? why? there's a different method you can use?

3. 2D lists
Please create two lists, one with 10 random integers from the number 1-10
and the second with 5 random integer from the number 1-5
Prepare a third list, this list should contain the two lists we've just created

4. List-to-string
Please createa a list with 10 random integers in it
Afterwards, please prepare a string from those integer
For example, if you've created a list looks like:
[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
The string you'll create afterwards should be:
'1345621345'
Note that this is a STRING and not an INTEGER

# Hint 1 
It may be worth replacing the integers found inside the list
to integers, think about it

5. Deleting a list 
Please prepare a list with 10 integers from the range of 1-10
Now, please remove the list, making it be empty

Question (ADVANCED):
How did you delete the list?
We can delete the list in two ways:

#1.
my_list = [1,2,3]
my_list = []

#2.
my_list = [1,2,3]
my_list.clear()

Whhat's the difference between those methodologies?
